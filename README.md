### Project was deployed to srisahith-korandla.surge.sh (can be viewed online there)

This Project is for my application for DALI for 24W. It is a personal website for the Basic Webpage Challenge. It consists of 4 webpages: Home, an About Page, a Project Page, and a Contact Page. I incorporated the theme of fall with the picture I used for myself (leaves changing in the background), and a picture on my about page of the learning trail I built also during the fall. 

The deployed webpage is viewable at srisahith-korandla.surge.sh
To view it locally, simply download the files and open up any of the html files in a web browser such as Google Chrome.
