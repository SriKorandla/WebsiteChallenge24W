                    <p2>Along with my friend Jaysen Quan, I built a Pokemon Battle Simulator that features all original 151 Pokemon. In this simulator, the Player, after chosing a team from any available pokemon, plays against an AI opponent with traditional Pokemon Battle Mechanics from the original Generation 1 games. Mechanics such as Type Effectiveness and Status Conditions have been replicated. This project was developed entirely in Java.</p2>

                    <p2>I developed a Web Application utilizing the Spotify Web API to develop more calming playlists. After securely logging in, the user gets to select one of their own playlists. From here, a new playlist is created with original songs that maintains the same feel of the originally selected playlist while having a more laid-back sound. Developed with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Vite, and Netlify. Currently waiting on approval for other users!</a>!</p2>
