            <p>I'm very passionate about using technology to solve problems on various different scales. You can check out a few of the <a href="projects.html" class="projects">projects</a> I have developed on the projects page. </p>

                <p>Iâ€™m a big fan of the outdoors! I was a Boy Scout for years, and attained my Eagle Scout in 2022. I love to hike and camp whenever I can! Above is a picture from my Eagle Project! For my project, I built a learning trail behind a local elementary school, and built educational signs for the students to learn from.</p>
                <p>I've been involved with the sport of weightlifting, or olympic lifting, for about 4 years. Recently, I've been sidelined with a knee injury and surgery, so I've been rehabbing. Eventually, I would like to compete at American Nationals in the upcoming years.</p>
                <p>In addition, I also love to read books and participate in trivia competitions. My favorite books of all time are Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and A Happy Death by Albert Camus. Did you know that Elephants cannot jump?</p>
